    Add experiment identifier to the dataset.

    This function processes the dataset by extracting an experiment identifier from the filename
    using a regular expression, adding it as a new dimension, and optionally dropping specified
    variables and dimensions from the dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
        The input dataset to be processed.
    regexp : str, optional
        The regular expression pattern to extract the experiment identifier from the filename,
        by default "id_(.+?)_".
    dim : str, optional
        The name of the new dimension to be added to the dataset, by default "exp_id".
    drop_vars : list of str or None, optional
        A list of variable names to be dropped from the dataset, by default None.
    drop_dims : list of str or None, optional
        A list of dimension names to be dropped from the dataset, by default None.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.Dataset
        The processed dataset with the experiment identifier added as a new dimension,
        and specified variables and dimensions dropped.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the regular expression does not match any part of the filename.

    Notes
    -----
    If `drop_dims` is not provided, it defaults to `["nv4"]`.
